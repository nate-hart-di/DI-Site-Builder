# DI Figma-to-Code Automation Research Plan

## Project Context

### Figma Design Example

**Arriba Motors Figma Project:**  
https://www.figma.com/design/Po0z0PhlF4pcmIy9ZnXsJU/Arriba-Motors-2--Copy-?node-id=0-1&m=dev

### Current DI Figma Integration Project

- **Location:** `/DI Figma to Code/`
- **Status:** Active development with FastAPI MCP server, CLI tools, and building blocks mapping
- **Current Capabilities:** Design token extraction, SCSS variable generation, building blocks mapping
- **Documentation:** VARIABLE_MAPPINGS.md, README.md, PLANNING.md

## Research Objectives

### Primary Goal

Find the best open-source/free way to sync local AI tools (Gemini CLI and/or Cursor) with Figma designs to automate site builds for Dealer Inspire themes.

### Secondary Goals

1. Identify tools that can export Figma designs to code compatible with DI standards
2. Evaluate AI tool integration capabilities for code refinement
3. Assess workflow automation potential for DI building blocks system

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Tool Identification

**Objective:** Identify open-source projects, tools, or free services designed to connect Figma designs with code generation tools.

**Research Areas:**

- Figma plugin marketplace for direct integrations
- GitHub repositories for community-built plugins
- Open-source "Figma to Code" converters
- Tools supporting React, Vue, Svelte, or clean HTML/CSS export

**Success Criteria:**

- Free or open-source licensing
- Active development (recent commits)
- Community engagement and documentation
- Code output quality assessment

### Phase 2: AI Tool Capability Analysis

**Objective:** Analyze input capabilities of Gemini CLI and Cursor for design file processing.

**Research Areas:**

- Direct design file processing capabilities
- Image representation handling
- Pre-generated code snippet refinement
- API integration possibilities

**Success Criteria:**

- File format support (SVG, PNG, HTML, JSON)
- Code generation and refinement capabilities
- CLI integration potential
- Documentation quality

### Phase 3: DI Compatibility Assessment

**Objective:** Evaluate each tool's compatibility with Dealer Inspire standards and building blocks.

**Assessment Criteria:**

- BEM naming convention support
- SCSS variable generation alignment
- PHP partial structure compatibility
- Responsive design pattern support
- ACF integration potential

**DI Standards to Validate:**

- File organization structure
- Naming conventions
- Code quality standards
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility compliance

### Phase 4: Workflow Integration Analysis

**Objective:** Determine how each tool can integrate with existing DI Figma-to-code workflow.

**Integration Points:**

- Current FastAPI MCP server compatibility
- CLI tool integration potential
- Building blocks mapping automation
- Preview server enhancement
- Export process optimization

## Research Questions

### Tool Evaluation Questions

1. What is the project's GitHub activity level and community engagement?
2. How recent and comprehensive is the documentation?
3. What is the quality and maintainability of generated code?
4. Does the tool support custom templates or code style configuration?
5. What are the tool's limitations and dependencies?

### AI Integration Questions

1. Can Gemini CLI process Figma exports directly?
2. What file formats does Cursor support for design input?
3. How can AI tools refine generated code to DI standards?
4. What automation potential exists for building blocks mapping?

### DI Compatibility Questions

1. Can the tool generate BEM-compliant class names?
2. Does output align with DI's 770+ variable design system?
3. Can it create PHP partials following DI template structure?
4. Does it support responsive design with proper breakpoints?
